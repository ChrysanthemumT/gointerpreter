parsing is a solved problem;

parser generators generate parsers for specific languages from specified inputs,
most commonly CGF (context free grammar) as their inputs, which is a set of rules that 
describe how to form correct sentences in a language. Most common formats, Backus-Naur Form (BNF),
or Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF)

PrimaryExpression ::="this"
        |ObjectLiteral
        |("("Expression")")
        ............ Example of EcmaScript syntax in BNF
parsers Yacc/bison for c-based languages, ANTLR (another tool for language recognition) for java C# python +

top-down parsing :recursive descent parsing, early parsing, predictive parsing
bottom-up parsing

parser for Monkeylang => recursive descent parser, "top down operator precednce" refered to as Pratt parser
after Vaughan Pratt
